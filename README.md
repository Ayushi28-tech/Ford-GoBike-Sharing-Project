# Ford-GoBike-Sharing-Project

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Ford GoBike system (January 2018 dataset) to uncover meaningful insights into user behavior, trip patterns, and business opportunities.

Using a structured approach, the data was:

  Imported, cleaned, and wrangled, addressing missing values and converting relevant columns (like datetime and age).

  Explored through 15 detailed visualizations across univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels.

  Each visualization addressed why the chart was chosen, what insights were revealed, and how it impacts business decisions.

# Key Insights:
Average trip duration is around 11–12 minutes.

Customers tend to take longer rides than subscribers, especially on weekends.

Subscribers dominate weekday, peak-hour rides, aligning with commute behavior.

Most users are aged 21–40, and a significant majority are male.

Trip duration is not heavily affected by seasons, but time of day and user type play a major role.

# Business Value:
These insights directly support the company in:

Enhancing marketing strategies,

Improving bike reallocation and availability,

Designing targeted pricing and subscription offers,

Expanding to underrepresented user segments.

The analysis offers a strong foundation for data-driven decision-making that can drive growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction in the competitive micromobility market.
